Indonesia will seek Chinaâ€™s help for renewable energy and infrastructure projects when President Joko Widodo attends the upcoming Belt and Road Forum in Beijing, a cabinet minister said. Any partnership with China would be parallel with the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) - a $20 billion deal Indonesia has with a U.S.-led group of countries to help decarbonise its energy sector, acting Chief Investment Minister Erick Thohir said in a Reuters interview on the weekend.
