Clean code is code that is easy to read, easy to understand, and easy to modify. Clean code follows a set of conventions and best practices that make it more consistent, making it easier for multiple developers to work on the same project seamlessly. Code that is difficult to understand is more prone to errors during modifications or enhancements.
