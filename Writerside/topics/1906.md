daily.dev started as a side project and evolved into a company with over 20 people serving a user base in the hundreds of thousands. They used technologies like React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Google App Engine in their initial development. They generated revenue through ads, partnering with developers-oriented ad networks. They also launched a web app using Next.js. They hired an engineering team, migrated to Kubernetes, and embraced Pulumi for infrastructure management. They built their own analytics solution using Go, Google Pub/Sub, and BigQuery. The feed was personalized in real-time using Tinybird and ClickHouse. The content pipeline was later migrated to Temporal. The backend team primarily used Go as the standard language. Automation, documentation, and DevOps were emphasized for consistent developer experience.
