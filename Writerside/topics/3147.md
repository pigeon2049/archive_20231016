A parent created the BallFields app to help other parents navigate youth travel sports facilities. The app uses Cloud Firestore as the backend platform for its robustness, scalability, and well-documented SDK. Important features of the app include a searchable store of facility information, search and geo-lookup capabilities, rating and comment systems, real-time messaging and image sharing, and GameDay reports. The app also utilizes distributed counters for high-throughput updates and Cloud Storage for media storage.
